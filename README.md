# HackGT-Temp

This is the repository used for my HackGT projects, SpecTackles. We switched repositories half-way through the hackaton.

To see the final project go to:
https://github.com/ktarafder/spectacles-frontend

There is also a backend-repository that you will need to use to make the web API work

I believe that the folder you want to use with the working build is StationaryCircles. The rest are old builds
You need to have a copy of Lens Studio to run and it was designed to work with the SnapChat Spectacles
